Dsense
======

This project is an attempt to create a system capable of detecting trends, events, and conversation on Twitter Public Stream. 

Events are detected using detecting entity and enriched with NLP tools. A semantic search engine indexes tweets using online LDA model. A detected event can be used to query the model as to find more similar tweets and enrich/confirm an event.
